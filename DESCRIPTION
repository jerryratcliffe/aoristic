Description: It can sometimes be difficult to ascertain when some events (such as property crime)
    occur because the victim is not present when the crime occurs. As a result, police databases often
    record a 'start' or 'from' date and time, and an 'end' or 'to' date and time. The difference between
    these date/times can be minutes, hours, or sometimes days: hence the term 'Aoristic'. 
    Aoristic is one of the past tenses in Greek and represents an uncertain occurrence time. 
    For events with a location describes with either a latitude/longitude, or X,Y, coordinate pair, 
    and a start and end date/time, this package generates an aoristic2 data.frame with aoristic weighted
    values for each hour of the week for each record.
    Outputs include an aoristic data frame, as well as summary graphs and displays.
